enforce that a resource must be closed by having your 
class implement the AutoCloseable interface and then using 
it in a try-with-resources block. This is the standard Java 
approach that helps ensure resources are closed automatically. 
For example:
public class MyResource implements AutoCloseable {
    public MyResource() {
        // Initialize resource
    }

    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Using resource...");
    }

    @Override
    public void close() {
        System.out.println("Resource closed.");
        // Clean up resource
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (MyResource res = new MyResource()) {
            res.doSomething();
        }
        // No need to explicitly call res.close()â€”it's done automatically.
    }
}
